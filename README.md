# Flower Classification Project

I created this as part of the RTX Future Ready Engineers Internship Program. This program detects types of flowers by using a convolutional neural network.   
Used Next.js + Tailwind.css for the website and hosting using Vercel. I used the Keras libary in Python to train the neural network and I also used flower data available on Kaggle.
